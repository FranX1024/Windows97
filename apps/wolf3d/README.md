This is a clone of what was released for wolfenstein 3D's 20th birthday with minor modifications to remove hard coded paths.

_p.s If anyone at Bethesda or id software has objections to this being hosted on github please let me know and I will remove it but I assume because Wolfenstein 3D is open source then you won't mind :)_
